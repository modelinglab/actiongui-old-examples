1. Preliminaries
=================
This simple example can be used to illustrate:

a) how web-based data-centric applications can be 
automatically generated from their data, security, and GUI models.

b) how fine-grained access control policy can be defined
in the security model.

c) how changes in the security model are automatically
reflected in the generated application, without having to
change the GUI models.

=====================
2. About the example
=====================
This example is a very basic CRM.

A) Data model
- There are two entities: customers are employees.
- Employees have a login and a password.
- Customers have a name, a surname, a date of birth (of type Date),
an email, a phone, and a loyalty-level (of type Integer).
- Employees may be in charge of customers (association customers<->contacts)

- Employees are the "users" of the applications. 
- There are two roles: "Manager" and "SalesPerson".
- Every employee has exactly one role.

B) Security model
B.1. SalesPerson
* With respect to employees
- It can read every employee's login.
- It can read and update its own password.
* With respect to customers
- It can read every customer's name, surname and loyalty level.
- It can access the employees in charge of every customer.
- It can read and update the birthday, email, and phone of its own customrs.
- For every customer, it can add itself to the employees in charge of this customer.

B.2. Manager
- It can do everything a salesperson can do.

* With respect to employees
- It can create new employees.
- It can read every employee's role.
- It can update every employee's data.
- It can delete every employee except itself.

- It can create, delete new customers.
- It can read and update every customer's data.

B.3. System
- It can read

C) GUI model
- Users need to login first, by introducing their login
and password.

C.1. SalesPerson
* Window: Search customers (under the given security policy)
- It can review all customers' information
- It can select a customer and  delete it.
- It can select a customer and edit it (in a different window)

* Window: Edit customer (under the given security policy)
- It can review the selected customer's information
(including its contacts points)
_ it can update the selected customer's information
(including its contacts points)

* Window: Change password: 
- It can change its own password

C.2. Manager 
* Window: Create employee (under the given security policy)
- It can create a new employee (and assign it a role)

* Window: Search employees (under the given security policy)
- It can review all employees' login information
- It can select an employee and  delete it.
- It can select an employee and edit it (in a different window)

* Window: Edit employee (under the given security policy)
- It can review the selected customer's information
(including its role)
_ it can update the selected customer's information
(including its role)

* Window: Create customer (under the given security policy)
- It can create a new customer
* Window: Search customers (under the given security policy)
- As explained above.
* Window: Edit customer (under the given security policy)
- As explained above.
* Window: Change password (under the given security policy)
- As explained above.

2. About the demo
=====================
These are mere suggestions. 
Probably we can find even better scenarios.

0. Explain the init-scenario: 
- employees: alice (passwd:1111) with role Manager;
bob (passwd: 1111) with role SalesPerson;
charlie (passwd: 1111) with role SalesPerson.
- no customers.

1. Show the basic functionality of the application:
1.1) login as alice
- create a new customer X 
- create another customer Y
- edit the customer X: assign this customer X to bob
- create another customer Z
- delete the customer Y.

1.2) log in as bob
- edit the customer X
- delete the customer Z (you should not not)
- edit the customer Z, without changing the contact points (you should not)

1.3) log in as charlie
- edit the customer X (you should not)
- edit the customer X, adding charlie as contact point (you should)

2. Change the security model and check the consequences
2.1) Comment the employee-delete permission for Managers
- login as alice
- delete charlie (you should not)

2.2) i) Remove the unconstrained email-read permission for SalesPerson,
and  ii) add an email-read permission for SalesPerson constrained by
self.contacts->includes(caller) 
- log in as alice
- search customers (nothing should be hidden)

- log in as bob
- search customers (emails should be hidden except for customer X)

3. Change the GUI model and check the consequences
(Before anything, add again the unconstrained email-red permission for
SalesPerson.)

3.1.) Change the order of execution of the actions
triggered by clicking on the button Edit in the window
Edit customers. In particular, move the add-action to the very last
position in the sequence.

3.1) log in as charlie
- edit the customer X, removing charlie as contact point (you should)
- edit the customer X, adding charlie as contact point (you should not)
